1. object-ident.py 1,2,&3 failed to run on rover due to missing file path. i noticed the file name in this dir is 'coco 1.names'. Let me know what I need to do differently. 

Begin error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pi/Desktop/Projects/github/STEM_Day/Object_Detection_Folder/Object_Detection_Files/object-ident-3.py", line 11, in <module>
    with open(classFile,"rt") as f:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/pi/Desktop/Object_Detection_Files/coco.names'

2. No README to explain what is the goal of the code or how to install & run. You can copy the template-project folder from DEV repo into STEM-DAY repo to help you get started. Obviously you should focus on finishing the build of basic functions in the code, but you should also be update the README constantly.
